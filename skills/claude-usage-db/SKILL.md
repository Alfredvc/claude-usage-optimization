name: claude-usage-db
description: Query the project's local DuckDB of ingested Claude Code transcripts (`transcripts.duckdb` at the repo root) to answer any question about sessions, costs, tokens, tools, models, cache hits, subagents, skills invoked, permission modes, or raw conversation data. Use this skill whenever the user wants to run SQL against that DB or asks analytical questions whose answer lives in it — "show me sessions from last week", "cost breakdown by model", "which tools did I call most", "how much on Opus yesterday", "pull the raw data", "find sessions where…", "longest sessions", "top Bash commands", "top files edited", "cache hit rate", "what skills have I used", "first-turn cache creation", "main-chain vs subagent cost", or any aggregate/filter/ranking over transcripts. Do NOT use for advice-shaped questions like "how do I reduce my spend" (that belongs to `optimize-usage`), for rebuilding the DB (that's the `cct` binary), or for questions about the transcripts file format itself. The DB has one critical billing footgun (raw `assistant_entries` overcounts cost ~2×) — this skill prevents it.

# Querying the Claude transcripts DuckDB

`transcripts.duckdb` (≈2 GB, at the repo root) is produced by the `cct` binary (this repo's Rust ingest tool) parsing Claude Code JSONL transcripts from `~/.claude/projects/`. Every assistant turn, user turn, tool call, hook event, and metadata record across all sessions lives here, typed and indexed.

Both `cct` and `duckdb` are required. If either is missing, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-cct-and-duckdb).

The raw JSONL line is **not** stored in the DB; every entry keeps `file_path` + `line_no` so the original line can be pulled from disk on demand (see [Accessing the original JSONL line](#accessing-the-original-jsonl-line)).

The schema is heavily self-documented via DuckDB `COMMENT ON` metadata — FK relationships, billing-safety warnings, and semantic notes. When in doubt, query the comments (see [Introspection](#introspection-when-stuck)).

---

## The billing pitfall (read first)

There is exactly one thing that will silently give you wrong numbers:

**Do not `SUM` cost or token columns on raw `assistant_entries`.** A single streaming assistant response writes one JSONL entry per content block (e.g. `thinking` + `text` + `tool_use` → 3 entries), and every one of those entries carries the same `message_id` and the same `usage` values. Summing the raw table double- (or triple-) counts those responses. Empirically this overcounts cost by ~2× on typical data.

**Use the `assistant_entries_deduped` view instead.** It's keyed on `(file_path, message_id)` and keeps the authoritative row per billing event (row with `stop_reason` set first, then largest `output_tokens`, then smallest `entry_id`). Unbilled rows (synthetic error messages from the client — `is_api_error_message = true` or `model = '<synthetic>'`) were never priced, so they have `cost_usd = NULL` and `SUM(cost_usd)` skips them automatically.

```sql
-- Total cost, correctly
SELECT ROUND(SUM(cost_usd), 2) AS total_usd
FROM assistant_entries_deduped;
```

Same rule for `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_5m`, `cache_creation_1h`. All marked `⚠ DO NOT SUM raw` in the schema comments.

**Three disjoint input buckets.** `input_tokens` (fresh), `cache_read_input_tokens`, and `cache_creation_input_tokens` are disjoint — the API bills each at its own rate. Don't add them looking for "total input cost"; `cost_usd` already combines them correctly. They're useful separately for diagnostics (cache hit rate, prefix invalidation signal, prompt-cache strategy).

## Schema model

Three conceptual layers, plus views.

### Root tables

| Table | PK | What |
|-------|-----|------|
| `transcripts` | `file_path` | one row per `.jsonl` file (a session or a subagent run). Carries `is_subagent`, `parent_session_id`, `agent_id`, `first_timestamp`, `last_timestamp`, `entry_count`, `ingested_at`. |
| `entries` | `entry_id` (BIGINT) | one row per JSONL line — the universal join key. |
| `model_pricing` | `model` | per-model USD/Mtok rates (fresh input, output, cache 5m, cache 1h, cache read) + `effective_date`. |

`entries.file_path → transcripts(file_path)` joins entries back to their source transcript.

### Variant tables (1:1 with `entries` by `entry_id`)

Each `entries` row has a `type` (`assistant` / `user` / `system` / `attachment` / `progress` / …) and exactly one row in the matching variant table:

| `entries.type` | Variant table |
|---------------|---------------|
| `assistant` | `assistant_entries` |
| `user` | `user_entries` |
| `system` | `system_entries` |
| `attachment` | `attachment_entries` |
| `progress` | `progress_entries` |

Plus narrow metadata variants (`permission_mode_entries`, `last_prompt_entries`, `ai_title_entries`, `summary_entries`, `pr_link_entries`, `mode_entries`, `tag_entries`, `task_summary_entries`, `worktree_state_entries`, `forked_*`, `marble_origami_*`, …). Run `SHOW TABLES` or query `duckdb_columns()` when you need one; most analytical queries don't.

**Always join variant tables through `entries`:**
```sql
SELECT e.timestamp, ae.model, ae.cost_usd
FROM entries e
JOIN assistant_entries_deduped ae ON ae.entry_id = e.entry_id
WHERE e.session_id = '<uuid>';
```

### Child tables (1:N with `entries` by `(entry_id, position)`)

One `entries` row can fan out to multiple child rows:

| Table | Holds |
|-------|-------|
| `user_content_blocks` | content blocks of a user message (text, tool_result, image, document) |
| `assistant_content_blocks` | content blocks of an assistant message (text, thinking, tool_use, redacted) |
| `assistant_usage_iterations` | per-iteration token decomposition for the Advisor server-tool beta (NOT billing — see [JSON columns](#json-columns-and-the-iterations-gotcha)) |
| `system_hook_infos` | hook invocations attached to a system entry (one row per hook fired) |
| `attachment_diagnostics_files` | diagnostics files referenced in an attachment entry |
| `attachment_invoked_skills` | skills invoked via an attachment entry — multiple skills can share one `entry_id` (batch-loaded at session start or on demand). `position` orders them; `invocation_metadata` is JSON and may be empty. |

### Views

| View | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `assistant_entries_deduped` | billing-safe cost/token aggregation. Same columns as `assistant_entries`, one row per `(file_path, message_id)`. |
| `tool_uses` | flat tool-call rows pulled from `assistant_content_blocks` where `block_type='tool_use'`. Exposes `name`, `tool_use_id`, `input` (JSON), plus convenience columns `effective_path`, `file_ext`, `input_command`, `input_path`, `input_file_path`, `input_notebook_path`, `caller_type`. Prefer this over parsing content blocks by hand. |

### Schema comment notation

- `→ table(col)` — hard FK; every row has a match.
- `~ table(col)` — **soft FK; the target row may be missing.** A naive JOIN silently drops rows. Most common case: `assistant_entries.model` with a version suffix (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) has no exact match in `model_pricing` (`claude-haiku-4-5`). Use a prefix-LIKE join — see [Joining against `model_pricing`](#joining-against-model_pricing).
- `⚠ DO NOT SUM raw` — use the deduped view.

## Common query recipes

### Total cost, total tokens
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(cost_usd), 2) AS usd,
       SUM(input_tokens)                AS fresh_in,
       SUM(cache_read_input_tokens)     AS cache_read,
       SUM(cache_creation_input_tokens) AS cache_create,
       SUM(output_tokens)               AS out_tok
FROM assistant_entries_deduped;
```

### Top sessions by cost
```sql
SELECT e.session_id,
       MIN(e.timestamp)          AS started_at,
       ROUND(SUM(d.cost_usd), 2) AS cost_usd
FROM assistant_entries_deduped d
JOIN entries e ON e.entry_id = d.entry_id
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY cost_usd DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### Cost by model
```sql
SELECT model,
       COUNT(*)                AS n_responses,
       ROUND(SUM(cost_usd), 2) AS cost_usd,
       SUM(input_tokens)       AS fresh_in,
       SUM(output_tokens)      AS out_tok
FROM assistant_entries_deduped
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY cost_usd DESC;
```

### Cost per day
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', e.timestamp) AS day,
       ROUND(SUM(d.cost_usd), 2)     AS cost_usd
FROM assistant_entries_deduped d
JOIN entries e ON e.entry_id = d.entry_id
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
```

### Cost per project (by `cwd`)
`cwd` appears on user/system entries and many assistant entries, but is sparse on some narrow-variant types. The robust attribution is "session's modal cwd", which tolerates NULLs:

```sql
WITH session_cwd AS (
  SELECT session_id, MODE(cwd) AS cwd
  FROM entries WHERE cwd IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY 1)
SELECT s.cwd,
       ROUND(SUM(d.cost_usd), 2) AS cost_usd
FROM assistant_entries_deduped d
JOIN entries e     ON e.entry_id  = d.entry_id
JOIN session_cwd s ON s.session_id = e.session_id
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY cost_usd DESC;
```

### Cache hit rate per model
Denominator is fresh input + cache read (the two "was this token already in cache?" outcomes). `cache_creation_input_tokens` is excluded because it's not a hit/miss event — it's the write that populates the cache for future reads, billed at its own rate.

```sql
SELECT model,
       SUM(cache_read_input_tokens)    AS cache_read,
       SUM(input_tokens)               AS fresh_input,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(cache_read_input_tokens) /
             NULLIF(SUM(cache_read_input_tokens) + SUM(input_tokens), 0), 1) AS pct_cached
FROM assistant_entries_deduped
GROUP BY 1;
```

### Tool usage frequency
```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM tool_uses
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC LIMIT 30;
```

### Bash commands run today
```sql
SELECT e.timestamp, t.input_command
FROM tool_uses t
JOIN entries e ON e.entry_id = t.entry_id
WHERE t.name = 'Bash'
  AND DATE_TRUNC('day', e.timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY e.timestamp;
```

### Files most often edited
```sql
SELECT effective_path, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM tool_uses
WHERE name IN ('Edit','Write','NotebookEdit')
  AND effective_path IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC LIMIT 30;
```

### Session duration and turn count
```sql
SELECT session_id,
       COUNT(*)                                             AS entries,
       DATE_DIFF('minute', MIN(timestamp), MAX(timestamp))  AS minutes
FROM entries
WHERE session_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY minutes DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### Skills invoked (frequency)
```sql
SELECT skill_name, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM attachment_invoked_skills
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC;
```

### Cost attributed to a skill
No hard attribution exists — an invocation doesn't directly tie a skill to a specific cost. A reasonable convention: all assistant turns in the same session after the skill loaded belong to it (as ceiling; double-counts when multiple skills overlap).

```sql
WITH loads AS (
  SELECT ais.skill_name,
         e.session_id,
         MIN(e.timestamp) AS loaded_at
  FROM attachment_invoked_skills ais
  JOIN entries e ON e.entry_id = ais.entry_id
  GROUP BY 1, 2)
SELECT l.skill_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT l.session_id)     AS sessions,
       ROUND(SUM(d.cost_usd), 2)        AS attributed_usd
FROM loads l
JOIN entries e              ON e.session_id = l.session_id AND e.timestamp >= l.loaded_at
JOIN assistant_entries_deduped d ON d.entry_id = e.entry_id
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY attributed_usd DESC;
```

Two interpretations to be aware of: (1) invocation count is a cleaner signal of "am I using this"; (2) attributed cost is an upper bound — when two skills load at the same attachment entry (common for batch loads), they share an `entry_id` and the post-load window is credited to both.

### Permission-mode usage
```sql
SELECT permission_mode, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM permission_mode_entries
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC;
```

### Preceding user message for an assistant turn
Useful when tracing why a turn exploded. `parent_uuid` on an assistant entry is polymorphic — can point at `user`, `assistant`, `attachment`, or `progress`. For the immediately preceding user entry (human prompt or tool result), walk back through `entries` filtered to `type='user'` and ordered by `entry_id` descending. Pass `<asst_entry_id>` as the target.

```sql
WITH target AS (
  SELECT session_id, entry_id AS asst_id
  FROM entries WHERE entry_id = <asst_entry_id>)
SELECT e.entry_id, e.timestamp, e.is_sidechain,
       u.message_content_text,
       LENGTH(u.message_content_text) AS text_chars,
       LENGTH(CAST(u.tool_use_result AS VARCHAR)) AS tool_result_chars
FROM target t
JOIN entries e       ON e.session_id = t.session_id
                    AND e.entry_id < t.asst_id
                    AND e.type = 'user'
JOIN user_entries u  ON u.entry_id = e.entry_id
ORDER BY e.entry_id DESC LIMIT 1;
```

Two flavors of user entry share this table: **plain-text prompts** populate `message_content_text` (tool_use_result NULL); **tool-result injections** populate `tool_use_result` (message_content_text NULL). Both count as "the preceding user turn" for cost-trace purposes — a huge tool result often explains a blown-up assistant turn more than the last human sentence. If you specifically want the last *human* prompt, filter `WHERE u.message_content_text IS NOT NULL AND NOT e.is_sidechain` and know you may skip several tool-result turns to get there.

### Most expensive individual turns
Top-N for spotting runaway single turns (huge tool-result payloads, oversized Agent prompts, cold-cache spawns):

```sql
SELECT e.timestamp, e.session_id, d.model,
       d.entry_id, d.cost_usd,
       d.cache_creation_input_tokens AS cc_tok,
       d.cache_read_input_tokens     AS cr_tok,
       d.output_tokens               AS out_tok
FROM assistant_entries_deduped d
JOIN entries e ON e.entry_id = d.entry_id
ORDER BY d.cost_usd DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 20;
```

For top-1% (looking at the tail rather than a fixed count), swap the `ORDER BY … LIMIT` for `PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY cost_usd)` filtered `>= 0.99`.

### First-turn cache creation per session (system-prompt sniff)
The first assistant turn of a fresh main session pays cache-creation on the whole system prompt (CLAUDE.md + MCP schemas + tool list + hooks). Distribution across sessions fingerprints how heavy the system prompt is. Use `entry_id` (not `timestamp`) to pick the first turn — timestamps can tie. Filter subagent transcripts, which have their own cold-start and aren't "fresh sessions" in the user sense.

```sql
WITH first_turn AS (
  SELECT e.session_id, MIN(e.entry_id) AS entry_id
  FROM entries e
  JOIN transcripts t ON t.file_path = e.file_path
  WHERE e.type = 'assistant' AND NOT t.is_subagent
  GROUP BY 1)
SELECT f.session_id,
       d.model,
       d.cache_creation_input_tokens  AS cc_tokens,
       ROUND(d.cost_usd, 4)           AS cost_usd
FROM first_turn f
JOIN assistant_entries_deduped d ON d.entry_id = f.entry_id
WHERE d.model != '<synthetic>'
ORDER BY cc_tokens DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 30;
```

For the distribution, wrap the same CTE and aggregate (keep the `model != '<synthetic>'` filter to keep zero-token client errors out of the percentiles):

```sql
-- ... same first_turn CTE ...
SELECT d.model,
       COUNT(*)                                            AS sessions,
       APPROX_QUANTILE(d.cache_creation_input_tokens, 0.5) AS p50,
       APPROX_QUANTILE(d.cache_creation_input_tokens, 0.9) AS p90,
       MAX(d.cache_creation_input_tokens)                  AS max_cc
FROM first_turn f
JOIN assistant_entries_deduped d ON d.entry_id = f.entry_id
WHERE d.model != '<synthetic>'
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY sessions DESC;
```

### Main-chain vs sidechain cost split
In this schema, `entries.is_sidechain = true` marks entries that belong to a subagent/sub-task branch; subagent-file entries are fully sidechain, main-session entries are not. This lets you split cost without joining through `transcripts`:

```sql
SELECT e.is_sidechain,
       ROUND(SUM(d.cost_usd), 2) AS cost_usd,
       SUM(d.input_tokens)                AS fresh_in,
       SUM(d.cache_read_input_tokens)     AS cache_read,
       SUM(d.cache_creation_input_tokens) AS cache_create,
       SUM(d.output_tokens)               AS out_tok
FROM assistant_entries_deduped d
JOIN entries e ON e.entry_id = d.entry_id
GROUP BY 1;
```

### Hook volume and time
`system_hook_infos` is narrow: `entry_id`, `position`, `command`, `duration_ms`. It records *that* a hook fired and how long it took — not its output. Hook-injected content that lands in the conversation shows up under `attachment_entries` (look for `hook_stdout` / `hook_content` / `hook_command` columns there).

```sql
SELECT command,
       COUNT(*)                                 AS n,
       ROUND(SUM(duration_ms)/1000.0, 1)        AS total_seconds,
       ROUND(AVG(duration_ms), 0)               AS avg_ms,
       MAX(duration_ms)                         AS max_ms
FROM system_hook_infos
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC;
```

For content-injection volume, join to `attachment_entries` where `hook_content IS NOT NULL` (or inspect `hook_stdout`):

```sql
SELECT hook_command,
       COUNT(*)                       AS n,
       AVG(LENGTH(hook_content))      AS avg_content_chars,
       AVG(LENGTH(hook_stdout))       AS avg_stdout_chars
FROM attachment_entries
WHERE hook_command IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC;
```

### Hour-of-day distribution (autonomous-loop sniff)
Regularly-spaced off-hours spawns are a tell for cron/loop setups. Timestamps are stored as UTC — convert to the user's local time before interpreting. Filter subagents out, otherwise a long daytime session spawning subagents at 2am looks like a 2am loop.

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(hour FROM e.timestamp) AS utc_hour,
       COUNT(*)                      AS turns,
       ROUND(SUM(d.cost_usd), 2)     AS cost_usd
FROM assistant_entries_deduped d
JOIN entries e     ON e.entry_id = d.entry_id
JOIN transcripts t ON t.file_path = e.file_path
WHERE NOT t.is_subagent
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
```

For an explicit scheduled-agent signal, look for `system_entries.subtype = 'scheduled_task_fire'` — the `schedule` skill emits one system entry per fire:

```sql
SELECT e.timestamp, e.session_id, se.content
FROM system_entries se
JOIN entries e ON e.entry_id = se.entry_id
WHERE se.subtype = 'scheduled_task_fire'
ORDER BY e.timestamp;
```

For fixed-interval (cron-like) detection, bucket `transcripts.first_timestamp` by `(hour, minute)` rounded to a tolerance, and require the same bucket to recur across several distinct days:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(hour FROM first_timestamp)       AS hr,
       (EXTRACT(minute FROM first_timestamp)::INT / 5) * 5 AS min_bucket,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(first_timestamp AS DATE)) AS distinct_days,
       COUNT(*)                                  AS n_sessions
FROM transcripts
WHERE NOT is_subagent AND first_timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(first_timestamp AS DATE)) >= 4
ORDER BY distinct_days DESC, n_sessions DESC;
```

---

## Subagents, sidechains, and forks

### Subagent transcripts (separate files)

**Subagent costs are NOT included when you group main-session entries by `session_id`.** They live in separate `.jsonl` files under `<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` and ingest treats each as its own transcript (`transcripts.is_subagent = true`, `parent_session_id → main session`, `agent_id → unique run id`). Forgetting this is the most common mis-attribution in cost analysis.

Attribute subagent cost to the parent session:

```sql
WITH sub AS (
  SELECT t.parent_session_id AS session_id,
         SUM(d.cost_usd)     AS subagent_cost
  FROM transcripts t
  JOIN entries e                    ON e.file_path = t.file_path
  JOIN assistant_entries_deduped d  ON d.entry_id  = e.entry_id
  WHERE t.is_subagent
  GROUP BY 1),
main AS (
  SELECT t.session_id,
         SUM(d.cost_usd) AS main_cost
  FROM transcripts t
  JOIN entries e                    ON e.file_path = t.file_path
  JOIN assistant_entries_deduped d  ON d.entry_id  = e.entry_id
  WHERE NOT t.is_subagent
  GROUP BY 1)
SELECT main.session_id,
       main.main_cost,
       COALESCE(sub.subagent_cost, 0)              AS subagent_cost,
       main.main_cost + COALESCE(sub.subagent_cost, 0) AS total_cost
FROM main LEFT JOIN sub USING (session_id)
ORDER BY total_cost DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### `is_sidechain` (entries) vs `is_subagent` (transcripts)

These describe the same phenomenon from two different angles on current Claude Code data:

- `transcripts.is_subagent` — this transcript is a subagent run (separate file).
- `entries.is_sidechain` — this entry belongs to a sidechain branch. In practice, every entry inside a subagent transcript is flagged sidechain; entries in main-session transcripts are not. Treat `is_sidechain` as the entry-level shortcut when you don't want to join `transcripts`.

If you ever see `is_sidechain = true` on an entry whose transcript is `is_subagent = false`, that's a speculative/branched turn within a main session — rare, include it in cost totals (it was billed).

### Forks and compaction

- `entries.forked_from_uuid` / `forked_from_session_id` — explicit session resume/fork (user picked up from a checkpoint). Every row in the forked session carries these.
- `entries.logical_parent_uuid` — preserves the logical parent across a context-compaction boundary, when `parent_uuid` breaks. Typically populated only at the boundary entry.
- `summary_entries` — one row per compaction event (the auto-generated summary that replaces older turns). Joining by `session_id` yields compaction points; absent if no session in the DB has compacted.

Turn-by-turn thread traversal that survives compaction: follow `logical_parent_uuid` when present, else `parent_uuid`.

---

## Joining against `model_pricing`

`model_pricing.model` is a short name (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5`) but `assistant_entries.model` is often a dated revision (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`). A naive `JOIN ON d.model = p.model` silently drops every revisioned row. Prefix-match instead:

```sql
-- Actual vs "no caching ever existed": apply fresh-input rate to all three input buckets;
-- output cost is identical in both scenarios so it cancels out of the delta (but include
-- it on both sides if you want absolute totals).
WITH rated AS (
  SELECT d.model                         AS db_model,
         p.model                         AS pricing_model,
         p.input_per_mtok, p.output_per_mtok,
         d.input_tokens, d.cache_read_input_tokens, d.cache_creation_input_tokens,
         d.output_tokens, d.cost_usd
  FROM assistant_entries_deduped d
  LEFT JOIN model_pricing p ON d.model LIKE p.model || '%')
SELECT db_model,
       ROUND(SUM(cost_usd), 2) AS actual_usd,
       ROUND(SUM(
         (input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens) * input_per_mtok / 1e6
         + output_tokens * output_per_mtok / 1e6
       ), 2) AS no_cache_usd
FROM rated
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY actual_usd DESC NULLS LAST;
```

Models absent from `model_pricing` (e.g. older revisions not loaded) show `NULL` on the `no_cache_usd` side. The ingester may also have skipped pricing them, in which case `actual_usd` is NULL too — surface those rows explicitly rather than silently dropping them.

`model_pricing` has two cache-creation rate columns: `cache_creation_5m_per_mtok` (default, cheaper) and `cache_creation_1h_per_mtok` (opt-in, longer TTL, pricier). If you want the actual cache-creation cost broken out, bill `cache_creation_5m` tokens at the 5m rate and `cache_creation_1h` tokens at the 1h rate — they're disjoint sub-buckets of `cache_creation_input_tokens`.

## JSON columns and the `iterations` gotcha

Polymorphic data is stored as DuckDB `JSON`. Query with `->`, `->>`, `json_extract`, `json_extract_string`.

| Column | Shape |
|--------|-------|
| `assistant_entries.iterations` | array of `{input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_*, type}` — Advisor server-tool beta decomposition |
| `assistant_content_blocks.tool_input` | per-tool input object (varies by tool) |
| `user_content_blocks.tool_use_result` | tool result payload |
| `assistant_entries.service_tier`, `speed`, `stop_details`, `inference_geo`, `container` | API response metadata |

**Do not sum `iterations`.** When the Advisor server-tool beta is active, a single assistant response may internally split into several "iterations" — the JSON array. Top-level `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` is the aggregate; iteration elements are a decomposition. Summing elements double-counts against the top-level (and single-iteration responses have top-level equal to `iterations[0]`, so summing appears to work on those and silently breaks on multi-iteration ones). If you need iteration-level data, use the flattened child table `assistant_usage_iterations` — it's pre-joined to `entry_id`.

## Accessing the original JSONL line

The raw JSONL line is intentionally not stored — it would roughly double DB size and every field is already parsed into typed columns. When you genuinely need the untouched line (debugging a parse failure, inspecting a field ingest dropped, reproducing an edge case), reconstruct it from `entries.file_path` + `entries.line_no` (1-indexed, matches `sed -n 'Np'` and `awk 'NR==N'`).

```sql
SELECT file_path, line_no
FROM entries
WHERE entry_id = <id>;        -- or: WHERE uuid = '<uuid>';
```

Then on disk:

```bash
awk "NR==<line_no>" "<file_path>" | jq '.'          # pretty
awk "NR==<line_no>" "<file_path>" | jq '.message.content'
```

Bulk extract (e.g. all entries of a session):

```sql
COPY (
  SELECT file_path, line_no
  FROM entries
  WHERE session_id = '<uuid>'
  ORDER BY line_no
) TO '/tmp/lines.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');
```

```bash
tail -n +2 /tmp/lines.csv | while IFS=, read -r fp ln; do
  awk "NR==$ln" "${fp//\"/}"
done | jq -c '.'
```

Notes on the source files:
- `transcripts.file_path` is absolute — under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/` for main sessions, `<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` for subagents.
- Source JSONL is append-only during a live session and immutable after. Line numbers are stable. If ingest ran and then the session continued, re-ingest to pick up new lines.
- If a source file is missing, the session was cleaned up on disk — nothing in the DB will recover the raw content.

## Prerequisites: `cct` and `duckdb`

Two tools need to be on `PATH`. Run these checks once per session; skip them if you've already queried the DB successfully in this conversation.

```bash
command -v cct    >/dev/null && cct --version    || echo "cct not installed"
command -v duckdb >/dev/null && duckdb --version || echo "duckdb not installed"
```

If `cct` is missing — ask the user first (external install):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alfredvc/claude-usage-optimization/main/install.sh | sh
# installs prebuilt binary to ~/.local/bin (override with CCT_INSTALL_DIR=..., pin with CCT_VERSION=v0.2.0)
```

If `duckdb` is missing:

```bash
curl https://install.duckdb.org | sh
# or https://duckdb.org/install/?platform=macos&environment=cli
```

### Locate the DB

If the user already gave a path, use it and skip this section. Otherwise:

```bash
ls -1 ./transcripts.duckdb 2>/dev/null
ls -1 ./*.duckdb 2>/dev/null
find . -maxdepth 3 -name '*.duckdb' -not -path '*/target/*' 2>/dev/null
```

Branches:

- **`./transcripts.duckdb` exists** → use it. Only re-check freshness (`SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM entries`) when the user is asking about "recent" / "today" / "latest session" — pure historical analytics don't need it.
- **A different `*.duckdb` file exists** → ask the user whether it's the transcripts DB before querying.
- **No `*.duckdb` found** → ask where the DB lives, or whether to generate one now with `cct ingest`. Don't silently run `cct ingest` — it scans `~/.claude/projects/` and writes a multi-GB file into cwd.

Once confirmed, use the same path in every `duckdb <path>` invocation. `cct ingest` is incremental (only new entries) so it's cheap to rerun mid-session.

## Running queries

One file, no server. From the repo root:

```bash
duckdb transcripts.duckdb                            # interactive
duckdb transcripts.duckdb "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entries;"
duckdb transcripts.duckdb < query.sql
```

Output modes that matter:

```bash
duckdb -csv   transcripts.duckdb "..."   # pipe-friendly
duckdb -json  transcripts.duckdb "..."   # structured scripting
duckdb -line  transcripts.duckdb "..."   # vertical: one field per line, great for wide rows
duckdb -list  transcripts.duckdb "..."   # unadorned rows
```

In interactive mode, `.mode box|markdown|json|csv`, `.headers on`, `.timer on`, `.maxwidth 200`, `.schema <name>` are the common knobs. `EXPLAIN <query>` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE <query>` check plan and timings.

### Performance

On a ~2 GB DB, full scans run in a few hundred ms to a few seconds. For interactive work, filter early — `session_id`, `timestamp`, `model`, `file_path` are all selective and DuckDB's column store handles them well. Heavy tables are `assistant_content_blocks` and `user_content_blocks`; unfiltered sorts there are noticeably slower. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` when something feels slow.

## Introspection (when stuck)

The DB documents itself — lean on that before guessing column names or relationships.

```sql
-- all tables and views
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT view_name, comment FROM duckdb_views() WHERE NOT internal;

-- columns + comments for a specific table
SELECT column_name, data_type, comment
FROM duckdb_columns()
WHERE table_name = 'assistant_entries' AND comment IS NOT NULL;

-- every column with a billing warning
SELECT table_name, column_name, comment
FROM duckdb_columns()
WHERE comment LIKE '%DO NOT SUM%';

-- discover FK relationships (hard and soft)
SELECT table_name, column_name, comment
FROM duckdb_columns()
WHERE comment LIKE '%→%' OR comment LIKE '%~%';

-- sample a table
SELECT * FROM assistant_entries_deduped USING SAMPLE 5 ROWS;
```

If a question feels like "what does column X mean?" or "how does table Y link to Z?" — ask the DB. Schema comments are authoritative; this skill is a guide on top of them.
